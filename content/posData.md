## **Introduction**

Cannabis retailers run promotions constantly—happy hours, daily deals, first-time customer discounts, and flash sales. But which ones actually drive profitability versus just reducing your margins? Many dispensaries make the mistake of judging success by revenue alone, potentially celebrating promotions that are actually costing them money.

At SeshData, our hedgehog mascot is always digging through the numbers to find the insights that matter. Here's how your existing POS data can reveal which promotions truly deserve to be repeated.

## **Why Revenue Alone Doesn't Tell the Full Story**

Before diving into our key metrics, let's address a common misconception: higher sales numbers don't automatically mean a successful promotion. A 25% off storewide sale might drive your biggest revenue day of the month, but if your margins are slashed and you're not acquiring retained customers, that "success" might actually be hurting your business.

Smart cannabis retailers look beyond the surface-level revenue bump to understand the true impact of their promotional strategies.

## **The 5 Key Metrics That Matter**

### **1\. Promotion Profit Margin**

**What it is:** The actual profit margin achieved during promotional periods compared to your standard margin.

**How to calculate it:**

Promotion Profit Margin \= (Revenue from Promotion \- COGS for Promoted Products) / Revenue from Promotion

Or If your business currently uses vendor backed promotions:  
Promotion Profit Margin \= (Revenue from Promotion \- COGS for Promoted Products \+ Vendor Credits) / (Revenue from Promotion)

**Why it matters:** A promotion that drives volume but destroys margin might not be worth repeating. Your POS data contains everything needed to calculate this precisely.

**Example insight:** "While your 'Buy One Get One 50% Off' vape cartridge promotion drove 4x normal daily sales, the profit margin dropped from your usual 42% to just 18%."

### **2\. New Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

**What it is:** How much you're effectively spending to acquire each new customer through a promotion.

**How to calculate it:**

Promotional CAC \= Total Discount Amount / Number of New Customers

**Why it matters:** Some promotions excel at bringing in new faces while others are mainly used by existing customers. Your POS system tracks first-time purchases, letting you see which promotions efficiently acquire new customers.

**Example insight:** "Your 'First-Time 20% Discount' costs you an average of $15 per new customer, while your 'Flash Friday 30% Off' costs $47 per new customer acquired."

### **3\. Basket Enhancement Rate**

**What it is:** How effectively a promotion encourages customers to purchase non-discounted items alongside promoted products.

**How to calculate it:**

Basket Enhancement Rate \= (Total Transaction Value \- Promoted Item Value) / Promoted Item Value

**Why it matters:** The best promotions don't just discount products—they drive additional full-price purchases.

**Example insight:** "Your BOGO pre-roll deal has a 3.2x basket enhancement rate, meaning customers typically add $3.20 of other products for every $1 of promotional pre-rolls."

### **4\. Customer Return Rate**

**What it is:** The percentage of customers who return to make a full-price purchase within 30 days after participating in a promotion.

**How to calculate it:**

Customer Return Rate \= Number of Promotional Customers Who Return Within 30 Days / Total Number of Promotional Customers

**Why it matters:** Promotions should build loyal customers, not just bargain hunters. Your POS system tracks customer purchase history, revealing which promotions create ongoing relationships.

**Example insight:** "42% of customers who participated in your 'Terpene Tuesday' educational promotion returned within a month, compared to just 12% from your 'Doorbusters' deep discount event."

### **5\. Inventory Velocity Change**

**What it is:** How quickly slow-moving inventory sells during and after promotions.

**How to calculate it:**

Inventory Velocity Change \= (Units Sold Per Day During Promotion / Average Units Sold Per Day) \- 1

**Why it matters:** Strategic promotions can help move aging inventory without requiring extreme discounts across your entire product line.

**Example insight:** "Your targeted 15% discount on slower-moving edibles increased their sales velocity by 340% during the promotion and maintained a 60% higher velocity for two weeks afterward."

## **Putting It All Together: The Promotion Effectiveness Score**

By combining these metrics, you can create a single "Promotion Effectiveness Score" that accounts for both short-term profit and long-term business health:

Promotion Effectiveness Score \= (Promotion Profit Margin × 0.4) \+ (New Customer Rate × 0.2) \+ (Basket Enhancement Rate × 0.15) \+ (Customer Return Rate × 0.15) \+ (Inventory Velocity Improvement × 0.1)

This weighted formula emphasizes profitability while still valuing customer acquisition and retention.
