## **Introduction**

For cannabis retailers, inventory is both your biggest asset and your biggest liability. Carry too much, and you tie up cash, risk product degradation, and waste valuable shelf space. Carry too little, and you miss sales opportunities and damage your reputation for reliability.

This balancing act becomes even more challenging in the cannabis industry, where products have limited shelf lives, customer preferences evolve, and vendors change their product selection regularly. Many dispensaries find themselves in a frustrating cycle – alternating between overstocking (fearing stockouts) and then discounting heavily to move aging product.

At ByteHog, we've analyzed inventory data from dozens of dispensaries and discovered that most cannabis retailers can reduce their inventory costs by 15-30% while maintaining or even improving product availability. The key? Using your own sales data to make smarter inventory decisions.

## **The Real Cost of Poor Inventory Management**

Before diving into solutions, let's quantify the problem. Poor inventory management typically costs cannabis retailers in four ways:

### **1\. Tied-Up Cash**

Every dollar sitting on your shelves is a dollar that can't be used for marketing, staff, expansion, or growing. For the average dispensary, inventory represents 30-45% of their assets – often hundreds of thousands of dollars that could be working harder for your business.

### **2\. Product Degradation**

Unlike most retail goods, cannabis products have a limited shelf life. Flower loses potency. Concentrates change consistency. Edibles approach expiration dates. These quality issues eventually lead to markdowns or even write-offs.

### **3\. Opportunity Cost**

Shelf space devoted to slow-moving products means less space for items that could be generating more revenue. This hidden cost is rarely measured but significantly impacts profitability.

### **4\. Labor Inefficiency**

Managing excessive inventory requires more staff time for receiving, auditing, rotating stock, and processing discounts on aging products.

For a dispensary with $2 million in annual sales, inventory inefficiencies could cost $50,000-$100,000 per year – a significant impact on the bottom line.

## **The Data-Driven Approach to Inventory Optimization**

The good news? Your POS system already contains most of the data you need to dramatically improve your inventory management. Here's how to put that data to work:

### **Step 1: Establish Your Baseline Metrics**

Before making changes, measure where you stand today:

**Inventory Turnover Rate:** Calculate how many times you sell through your entire inventory annually.

Inventory Turnover \= Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value

For cannabis retailers, healthy turnover rates vary by product category:

- Flower: 12-24 times per year (turning over every 2-4 weeks)
- Concentrates: 8-12 times per year
- Edibles: 10-15 times per year
- Accessories: 4-8 times per year

**Days of Supply:** How many days your current inventory would last based on average sales.

Days of Supply \= (Average Inventory Value / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

**Stockout Rate:** The percentage of time products are unavailable when customers want them.

Stockout Rate \= Number of Days Out of Stock / Total Number of Days

These baseline metrics will help you track improvement and identify your biggest opportunity areas.

### **Step 2: Segment Your Inventory by Velocity**

Not all products should be managed the same way. Use your sales data to categorize your inventory into velocity segments:

**A-Items (Fast Movers):**

- Top 20% of products by sales volume
- Typically represent 70-80% of revenue
- Need highest service levels and most frequent reordering

**B-Items (Moderate Movers):**

- Middle 30% of products by sales volume
- Usually represent 15-25% of revenue
- Require regular but less frequent attention

**C-Items (Slow Movers):**

- Bottom 50% of products by sales volume
- Often represent just 5-10% of revenue
- May require significant reduction or elimination

This ABC analysis should be performed at the individual product level (not just categories) and updated monthly as trends change.

### **Step 3: Identify Pattern-Breaking Events**

Cannabis retail has unique pattern-breaking events that affect inventory needs:

**Predictable Demand Spikes:**

- Paydays (1st and 15th of month)
- Holidays (4/20, 7/10, etc.)
- Local events (concerts, festivals)

**Supply Chain Disruptions:**

- Harvest schedules
- State testing backlogs
- Seasonal product availability

Your historical sales data reveals exactly how these events affected your business in the past, allowing you to prepare appropriately rather than guessing at needed quantities.

### **Step 4: Implement Category-Specific Stocking Rules**

Different product categories require different inventory approaches:

**Flower:**

- Higher turnover expectations
- More sensitive to freshness

**Concentrates:**

- Mid-range turnover
- Less sensitive to short-term storage
- More brand loyalty from consumers

**Edibles:**

- Long shelf life but strict expiration dates
- Typically less sensitive to small price differences

**Accessories:**

- Slowest turnover
- No expiration concerns
- Higher margins can justify slower turns

Each category should have its own turnover targets and reordering parameters.

## **Practical Implementation: Getting Started with Data-Driven Inventory**

Ready to optimize your inventory using data? Here's a step-by-step approach that any cannabis retailer can implement:

### **1\. Create Your Product Velocity Report**

Use sales data from your POS to build a report that calculates the following:

- Average daily units sold
- Days of supply at current inventory levels
- Days since last received
- Gross margin percentage
- Whether sales are trending up or down

Sort products by velocity (units sold per day) and identify your clear A, B, and C items.

### **2\. Set Inventory Targets by Category**

For each product category, establish target days of supply:

**A-Items:**

- Target: 14-21 days of supply
- Review: Weekly
- Safety stock: Higher to prevent stockouts

**B-Items:**

- Target: 21-30 days of supply
- Review: Bi-weekly
- Safety stock: Moderate

**C-Items:**

- Target: 30-45 days of supply (or consider eliminating)
- Review: Monthly
- Safety stock: Minimal

### **3\. Develop an Inventory Reduction Plan**

For overstocked items, create a graduated approach:

1. Stop ordering until levels reach targets
2. Reduce shelf space/facings
3. Consider promotions for items significantly overstocked
4. For true dead stock, consider bundle deals or aggressive clearance

### **4\. Implement Regular Review Cycles**

Schedule regular inventory review sessions:

- Weekly: Review A-items and place orders
- Bi-weekly: Review B-items and adjust as needed
- Monthly: Full inventory review including C-items
- Quarterly: Category performance review and assortment planning

### **5\. Measure and Adjust**

Track these key metrics monthly:

- Overall inventory value
- Turnover rate by category
- Stockout percentage
- Weeks of supply
- Percentage of inventory older than 60 days

## **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

As you implement data-driven inventory management, watch out for these common mistakes:

### **1\. Focusing on Vendor Deals Instead of True Needs**

Many dispensaries overbuy to hit vendor discount tiers. Calculate whether the discount truly outweighs the cost of carrying excess inventory and the risk of markdowns later.

### **2\. Emotional Attachment to Products**

Let data, not personal preferences, drive your inventory decisions. Just because you love a product doesn't mean it deserves shelf space if the sales data doesn't support it.

### **3\. Treating All Products Equally**

Your top 50 products deserve much more attention and stricter management than your bottom 500\. Don't waste equal time on products with vastly different business impacts.

### **4\. Ignoring Seasonality**

Cannabis sales have predictable seasonal patterns. Use year-over-year data to adjust for these patterns rather than reacting to short-term trends.

### **5\. Not Considering Product Relationships**

Some products sell well together. Optimizing each product individually without considering these relationships can lead to missed bundling opportunities.
